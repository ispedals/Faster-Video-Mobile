# Faster Video Mobile

Addon for Firefox for Android that allows one to change the playback rate of HTML5 videos.

When a HTML5 video is playing, you can adjust the playback rate from the menu under the heading `Video Speed`.
If there is more than one video playing or if the video is paused, the playback rate cannot be changed.

Requires at least Firefox for Android 20.0.
